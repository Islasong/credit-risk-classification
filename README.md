Credit Risk Analysis Report

Purpose of analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to build a logistic regression model to predict the borrowers' creditworthiness. And then determine the performance by using the confusion matrix and analysing the classification report. 

•	The independent variables include： loan size, interest rate, borrow income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debts.

•	The dependent variable is loan status (0 is healthy, 1 is unhealthy.)


Result

•	Healthy loan status:
Balanced Accuracy: 94.43%
Precision: 100%
Recall: 99%

•	Unhealthy loan status:
Balanced Accuracy: 94.43%
Precision: 85%
recall: 91%

Summary

The model demonstrates high accuracy and effectiveness in predicting healthy loans (0) with perfect precision and recall. While the prediction performance for high-risk loans (1) is slightly lower, it still achieves a reasonably good precision, and recall. Overall, the logistic regression model has excellent predictive performance for both healthy loan status and high-risk loan status.
